# ThinkHub
ThinkHub is a project management software for think tank style research groups. We allow users to create projects, link documents/policies to those projects, create tasks and within those tasks, create edits/revisions/suggested updates to the documents/policies.

# What does this do?
When a project is created, the project manager can create tasks, assign those tasks to a researcher and the researcher can then access the link to the file and write their own suggestions on the documents. The project summariser then utilises these tasks by accessing each task within the project, displaying the original text and the proposed update to that text in a PDF format with one button press.
